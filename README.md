# California House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices in California using machine learning models. It explores the relationship between various features such as median income, total rooms, population, and geographical location with median house values. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and training machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict house prices accurately.
